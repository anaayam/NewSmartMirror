# Smart Mirror
My project is a Smart Mirror powered by raspberry pi. It has Spotify, camera, weather, and time APIs.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is being able to take pictures and adding a two way mirror. To add the camera feature, I downloaded the module from a github website and added it to my SmartMirror folder. After that, I had to install the camera by inserting it into the camera slot, which is between Ethernet and HDMI Port. To test it out, I used the command raspistill -o cam.jpg and that displayed what my camera was pointed at onto the screen. For the two way mirror, I used a box cutter to score it after measuring the dimensions and marking it. Then, I was able to break it by folding the mirror on the mark. I used double sided tape to secure it to the monitor, so the mirror would be removable.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the raspberry pi. To do this, I used an SD card to download the raspbian software from the website and then connect the card to the raspberry pi. Then, I downloaded all the basic code for the Magic Mirror from the github website. I deleted any features that I didn’t want on the mirror, including the calendar and US holiday modules, from the configuration file. Additionally, I added touchscreen and camera capabilities by adding the downloaded code to the modules folder. After that, I adjusted the compositions of the icons on the magic mirror through the configuration file by editing the position and then sizing so everything fit.
