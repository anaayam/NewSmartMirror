# Smart Mirror
My project is a Smart Mirror powered by raspberry pi. It has Spotify, camera, weather, and clock APIs.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was finalizing the composition of the mirror. I made the spotify API smaller so that it wouldn’t cover up the time module while music was playing. I did this by changing the type of player from the default to a mini version of it through the configuration file. Additionally, I changed the time module from a 24-hour clock to a 12-hour so that it’s easier to read. I also attached a microphone so that Spotify could play through there instead of an outside speaker.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is being able to take pictures and adding a two way mirror. To add the camera feature, I downloaded the module from a github website and added it to my SmartMirror folder. After that, I had to install the camera by inserting it into the camera slot, which is between Ethernet and HDMI Port. To test it out, I used the command raspistill -o cam.jpg and that displayed what my camera was pointed at onto the screen. For the two way mirror, I used a box cutter to score it after measuring the dimensions and marking it. Then, I was able to break it by folding the mirror on the mark. I used double sided tape to secure it to the monitor, so the mirror would be removable.

# Second Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the raspberry pi. To do this, I used an SD card to download the raspbian software from the website and then connect the card to the raspberry pi. Then, I downloaded all the basic code for the Magic Mirror from the github website. I deleted any features that I didn’t want on the mirror, including the calendar and US holiday modules, from the configuration file. Additionally, I added touchscreen and camera capabilities by adding the downloaded code to the modules folder. After that, I adjusted the compositions of the icons on the magic mirror through the configuration file by editing the position and then sizing so everything fit.
